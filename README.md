# About
I started to code the first version of this mod in 2005. Back then it was a private mod and only few people had access. So as a personal task and due to some people request i decided to re-code the mod into a public version, just as a legacy.

The next list is all *features* from the original **Jedi Knight Plus** private mod _(2005 & 2008 versions)_ which need to be ported into the new source code. _(Each completed task will be marked with a check)_
